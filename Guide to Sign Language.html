                    <p>Core issues: vocabulary, short sentences, and national differences </p>
                </header><p>Words: Overall, it is not difficult to find and learn sign language for a single word, and the meaning of the word can be expressed by making corresponding gestures, similar to oral communication.</p>
                </header><p>Short sentence: What is the order in which isolated words express short sentences? Does facial expression represent simple punctuation? Learning short sentences is necessary for communication between sign language users.</p>
                <p>Once you learn how to spell each letter in the alphabet with your fingers, it's time to improve your sign language expression! Check the following tips to improve your finger spelling ability:
                    Pause between spelling individual words. This can improve the comprehensibility of the signature.
                    When spelling each word, please place your hands in one place. This may require practice, but it can make it clearer for others to read back. An exception is when you spell acronyms by hand. In this case, move each letter by a small circle to let people know not to read these letters together as a single word.
                    If you are using your fingers to spell a word with two letters, please flick your hand between these two letters to indicate the repetition of the letter. You can also indicate that the letter should be doubled to complete this operation by sliding it slightly to one side. At the beginning of learning finger spelling, it is difficult not to jump back and forth between each letter. You can hold the handwriting with your empty hand to help stabilize it during practice. Ultimately, you will be accustomed to keeping your hands stable while spelling with your fingers.
                    Keep the hand spelled with fingers at shoulder height. This is the most comfortable place for you to sign and the other person to read.
                    Maintain a consistent pace. There is no need to spell words quickly. More importantly, each letter is clear and the overall rhythm is consistent.</p>

                        </header><p>For the simplest letters, the letter expression in sign language is very simple, completed by a single hand. If you want to complete a word, you only need to learn the words expressed by a single hand - although in sign language in very few countries, word expression requires two hands.</p>
